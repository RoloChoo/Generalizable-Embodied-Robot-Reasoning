# Generalizable Embodied Robot Reasoning : A Unified Platform and Benchmark Framework in open world
The AIAgents simulation environment and MineCollab benchmark suite are used in this paper to evaluate large language model (LLM) agents in embodied multi-agent environments. MineCollab offers procedurally generated collaborative cooking, crafting, and building activities, while AIAgents provides high-level tool abstractions for open world agent interaction.
# Abstract
We evaluate prominent LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and LLaMA3 variations over job difficulty and agent collaboration burden. Current LLMs have substantial communication and execution delays when expanded to multi-agent coordination, despite promising potential. Finally, we suggest memory augmentation, planning integration, and community-driven framework growth.
